```

If you want to install the image on a new system download and install Bazzite ISO first:

<https://download.bazzite.gg/bazzite-stable-amd64.iso>

## Custom commands

The following `ujust` commands are available:

```bash
# Clean up old packages and Docker/Podman images and volumes
ujust amy-clean

# Install all Amy OS apps
ujust amy-install

# Install only Flatpaks
ujust amy-install-flatpaks

# Install only Nix packages
ujust amy-install-nixpkgs

# Setup Amy OS settings for Cursor and VSCode
ujust amy-setup-editors

# Setup Nix Home Manager with Amy OS config
ujust amy-setup-home

ujust amy-setup-nix

ujust amy-setup-samods

ujust amy-fix-bt

# Manage SSD encryption optimizations (Workqueue and TRIM)
ujust amy-ssd-crypto
```

## Package management

GUI apps can be found as Flatpaks in the Discover app or [FlatHub](https://flathub.org/) and installed with `flatpak install ...`.

CLI apps are available from [Nix](https://search.nixos.org/packages) using `nix profile install nixpkgs#...` or setting up Home Manager with `ujust amy-setup-home` and changing `~/.config/home-manager/home.nix` packages list. GUI apps usually work fine too.
